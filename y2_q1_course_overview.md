# Q1

## Computer Graphics

### Environment Setup
We only support Windows in this course (for some reason). If you are running a different Operating System then we recommend that you install Windows in a Virtual Machine (VM). We also recommend a VM if you are having issues running the software on your Windows machine. We provide a preconfigured Virtual Machine containing all required software (see VM Install Guide).

### Learning Materials
Textbooks are not mandatory but the following book is highly recommended for this course:

- *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics*, 4th Edition, Steve Marschner and Peter Shirley, CRC Press
(e-book available from the TU Delft Library)

The following books can be used as extra resources:

- *Computer Graphics. Principles and Practice* by James D. Foley, Andries VanDam, Steven K. Feiner - Addison Wesley
Very complete, goes far beyond the course but covers all topics.

- *Mathematics for 3D Game Programming & Computer Graphics* by Eric Lengyel - Charles River Media (contains also exercises)
More focus on linear algebra, contains not all topics of the course but offers exercises.

- *Real-time Rendering* by Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman - Peters, Wellesley
Complete but higher level, with many more content related to real-time approaches.

- *Real-Time Shadows * by Elmar Eisemann, Michael Schwarz, Ulf Assarsson, Michael Wimmer - Taylor & Francis
Only suggested for learning more about the particular topic of shadows.

### Assignments
There are individual assignments and the final project at the end. Check the schedule pdf file for due dates. All assignments are due by 23:59.

#### Individual Assignment
There are 6 individual assignments, of which 5 will be evaluated with the weights: 15%, 25%, 25%, 25%, 10%. Each assignment should be completed within 1 week after the handout (deadlines will be available via Brightspace).

Committing fraud in one of the assignments leads to the invalidation of the whole Assignment grade.

#### Final Project
The final project is done in groups but students can receive individual grades based on their performance. You can't choose your own group; the group distribution is determined by the grades of the first three individual assignments. There will be 3 students per group.

### Exam
The endterm exam will be physical. There are multiple-choice and potentially open-ended questions. A simple calculator without programming capabilities is permitted. All exams will have similar *types* of questions but never the same questions.

### Assessment
The practical grade is given as: P=0.4*A + 0.6*F and mathematically rounded in .1 steps.
The exam grade is given as 100% from the physical exam.
The final grade is 50% from the exam grade and 50% from the practical grade. 

### Resit
One resit available for the exam - participation is possible without any conditions. The maximum grade of the first exam and the resit will constitute the exam grade E.

No resit available for assignments.

There is a resit for the Final Project linked to certain conditions:
It will take the form of a new individual project and is only available to those that have an average >=6 points for their Assignment grade [A] and a >=6 for their first exam grade (not the resit). It only allows the participants to increase their Final Project grade [F] to maximally a 6.

### Passing Policy
To pass the course each exam grade and practical grade should be >=5.0, and the final grade should be >=6.0.

### Communication
Ask academic related quetions in Answers system or StackOverFlow. You can ask questions using the tag cse2215. 

For personal circumstances, send an e-mail to the course mailbox: cg-cs-ewi@tudelft.nl

The dates for the exam/project presentations are on mytimetable.tudelft.nl

If the question concerns your lab code specifically, ask the TA's during the lab.


## Machine learning

### Learning Materials
We strongly advise you to read the material before each lecture. We will mainly use the following book:

- *Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning* by Chris Bishop.

The download link to the pdf is available on Brightspace.

Additional reading materials may be used in some weeks.

### Assignments
All assignments are optional but highly recommended as they form an important part of the exam material. The answers to these exercises will not be provided(why not?). Follow the exercises in the notebooks either on your own or with a peer.

#### Practice assignment
Posted on https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cse2510/2022-2023

#### Lab notebooks
Posted on brightspace

#### Bonus assignment
There is an assignment that you can do invidually or in a group of maximally 2, which, if successfully completed, will raise your final grade up to 0.5 (only if you already received a passing grade for the exam). 

The deadline for the assignment is November 4 at 23:59, and the assignment will be posted a few weeks prior. Questions related to the bonus lab assignment can be asked during the lab of week 8.

### Exam
The endterm exam will be on-campus on the weblab platform. The exam is closed book but you will have access to Python and Numpy documentation. The exam consists of two types of questions:

- Implementation questions, similar to the lab notebooks
- Theory questions, similar to the weekly weblab questions

### Assessment
The final grade is 100% of the exam grade. If you get a passing grade on the exam, the bonus assignment grade will be factored into the final grade.

### Resit
There is one resit in Q2 for the physical exam.

### Passing policy
The passing grade is 5.8.

## Big Data Processing

### Environment Setup
During our course we will learn how to process data with:

- Unix, the de-facto standard for small-ish data
- Spark, and related libraries, for batch processing
- Flink for stream processing
- Spark and custom code for graphs

The course will be using the following 2 programming languages

- Bash: for automating data processing
- Scala: the de-facto standard for high performance data processing

### Learning Materials

#### Online Resources
The online teaching materials are provided here: https://burcuku.github.io/cse2520-bigdata/

Portions of this course have been converted to online educational material by other TU Delft teachers. Please take a look at the following EdX MOOCs / ProfEds:

- Unix Tools: Data, Software and Production Engineering, by Diomidis Spinellis
- Introduction to Functional Programming for Big Data Processing, by Jan Rellermeyer
- Taming Big Data Streams: Real-time Data Processing at Scale, by Asterios Katsifodimos

Use them at your discretion to improve your skills.

### Assignments
There are 4 assignments and all assignments are mandatory. For submission, we will use Weblab. There you need to signup to enroll and also declare your pairs. 

All the assignments have deadlines. The student groups must submit each assignment before 23:59 on the day of the deadline.

Feedback and grading is automatic: the results are available on CPM.

Late submission: All submissions must be handed in time, with no exceptions. Any late submission will be discarded and will be graded with 0. In case of provable sickness, please contact the course teacher to arrange a case-specific deadline.

### Exam
There is a written exam which is closed-book exam.

### Assessment
The assignment grade is calculated as the mean grade of all assignments; non submitted assignments are graded with 0.
Each assignment is worth 10% of the overall assignment grade.

The final grade is 40% of the assignment grade and 60% of the exam grade. 

### Resit
The resit covers only the exam. It is not possible to resit the lab assignments. Partial grades (assignments or exam) cannot be transferred to subsequent years.

### Passing policy
The final lab grade has a minimum of 5. 

The written exam has a minimum grade of 5.

The passing grade is 5.8.

### Communication
join the BDP 2022-2023 Mattermost team

    General questions can be asked here. Questions specific to your solutions should be asked during the lab
    TAs won’t always be active; don’t expect answers outside of lab hours
    You are recommended to help each other, but refrain from sharing solutions (this is considered fraud)
    Be nice :)
    Assignment technical support: ask the Mattermost channel. If no feedback after 1 hour: DO ASK THE TAs.

Online lab sessions every Wednesday afternoon
